# Contact Manager

A simple command-line application for keeping a personal contact list. Each contact can include a name, phone number, email address, and street address. Contacts are saved to a local `contacts.json` file in the same folder as the program, so they remain available after you exit.

## Features

- Add contacts with a required name and optional phone, email, and address.
- View the full contact list with each contact's name and phone number.
- Search for a contact using part or all of a name or phone number.
- View all details for contacts that match a search.
- Update contact details; leave a field blank to keep its current value.
- Delete a contact after confirming the choice.
- Save changes automatically after adding, updating, or deleting a contact.
- Provide clear feedback for invalid menu choices and missing search results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer.
- No third-party packages are required.

## Run the program

Open a terminal in the folder containing `contact_manager.py` and run:

```sh
python contact_manager.py
```

If your system uses `python3` to launch Python, run `python3 contact_manager.py` instead.

## Menu options

1. **Add contact** — Enter a name, phone number, email, and address. Only the name is required.
2. **View contact list** — See the saved names and phone numbers.
3. **Search** — Find matching contacts by name or phone number. Search ignores letter case and accepts partial matches.
4. **Update contact** — Select a contact by its list number and enter revised details. Press Enter to keep a field unchanged.
5. **Delete contact** — Select a contact and confirm the deletion.
6. **Exit** — Close the program. Changes have already been saved to `contacts.json`.

## Data storage

The application creates `contacts.json` beside the Python script the first time a contact is added. This is a plain-text file in JSON format. Keep a backup if the contact list is important, and avoid sharing the file because it may contain personal information.
