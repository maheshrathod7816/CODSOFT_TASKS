# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A friendly, text-based Python game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. Choose a move, see both selections, and get immediate feedback about the round. The game tracks wins, losses, and ties across multiple rounds.

## Features

- Accepts rock, paper, or scissors without regard to capitalization.
- Chooses the computer's move at random.
- Applies the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
- Displays both moves and tells you whether you won, lost, or tied.
- Tracks your score, the computer's score, and ties for the current session.
- Lets you play another round or quit. Enter `q` at the choice prompt to exit.
- Re-prompts with clear feedback when an entry is invalid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer.
- No third-party packages are required.

## Run the game

Open a terminal in the folder containing `rock_paper_scissors.py` and run:

```sh
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

If your system uses `python3` to launch Python, run `python3 rock_paper_scissors.py` instead.

## How to play

1. Enter `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` when prompted.
2. The computer makes its choice, and the game displays both moves and the round result.
3. Review the running score.
4. Enter `y` to play another round or `n` to finish. You can also enter `q` at the move prompt to quit.

Scores reset when you close and restart the program.
